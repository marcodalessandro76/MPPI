MPPI
=======
Multi Purpose Python Interface  

Python package for managing computations and performing post-processing in QuantumESPRESSO and Yambo

Documentation
-------------
You can read the documentation in:  

https://mppi.readthedocs.io/en/devel/

Features
--------
The package is composed by several module each of which contains one ore more classes:

- InputFiles : Create QuantumEspresso and Yambo input files. For the management of QE we use  a modified version of the PwIn class of YamboPy
  compatible with python 3, while for the construction of the Yambo inputs we use a modified version of the class YamboIn of YamboPy.  
- Calculators : prepare and run a QuantumESPRESSO or Yambo computation. The class also manages the parsing of the output file generated by the
  run.
- Datasets : organize and run several computations for both QE and Yambo. This class is the main tool to perform computations using MPPI.

Tutorials and examples
----------------------
We provide some jupyter notebooks to show the functionality of the package.
