MPPI
=======
Multi Purpose Python Interface  

Python package for managing computations and performing post-processing in QuantumESPRESSO and Yambo

Documentation
-------------
You can read the documentation in:  

https://mppi.readthedocs.io/en/devel/

Features
--------
The package is composed by several module each of which contains one ore more classes:

- InputFiles : Create and manage input files for pw.x of the the QuantumEspresso package and for Yambo.
- Calculators : prepare and run a single QuantumESPRESSO or Yambo computation. The class also manages the 
  parsing of the output file generated by the run.
- Datasets : organize and run several computations for both QuantumESPRESSO and Yambo. This class is the main 
  tool to perform computations using MPPI.
- Datasets : Collect some useful low-level functions used by the other modules of the package.

Tutorials and examples
----------------------
We provide some jupyter notebooks to show the functionality of the package.
