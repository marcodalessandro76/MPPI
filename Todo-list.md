----

- Check the compilation of the ReadTheDocs documentation.

- Add the spin to the Dos class.

- Complete the Analysis_Dos notebook.

- Add a from_Yambo method in the Dos class. The output of the YamboParser does not contain
  information on the weights of the kpoints. These information can be extracted from ns.db1
  using the YamboElectronsDB class of yambopy or from the xml file of the pw output used to
  build the SAVE folder.

- Study the getFermi method of electronsdb of YamboPy. It can be an easy addon to the fermi method of PwParser

- Complete the reference_column_names_extendOut for the real-time runlevels.
